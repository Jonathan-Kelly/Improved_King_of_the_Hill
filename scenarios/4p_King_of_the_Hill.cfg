    description= _ "As a final act, The Mage King cursed his squabbling lords, that their castles should fall into ruin whenever one of them sits upon his forsaken Hill Throne. Are you mighty enough to take this literal seat of power before your rivals do? Can you hold out against their many assassins? Is your arse truly wide enough to fill the throne of a king? This 4 player FFA map works fine 2 vs. 2 as well. There are 36 villages." + _ " Recommended setting of 2 gold per village and 150 starting gold."
